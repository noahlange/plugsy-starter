# plugsy-starter
A small repository designed to help you get up and running quickly with Plugsy.

Includes a functioning webpack config, tslint config and tsconfig config designed to work with [plugsy-console](https://github.com/noahlange/plugsy-console/), so you can quickly and easily test your plugins.

Fork this repository on GitHub, then clone it to your machine. Alternatively you
can download the .zip or .tar.gz or whatever, but I don't entirely recommend
that.

## Installing
Getting started with Yarn.

```bash
yarn && yarn run watch
```

Or with NPM.

```bash
npm i && npm run watch
```
